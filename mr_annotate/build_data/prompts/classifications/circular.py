Question:

If $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$, what is the value of $x^3 - 2x + 1$?

Answer:

Step 1. Let's start with the first equation and see if we can solve for x.

Step 2. Ok. We can use the quadratic formula to find x.

Step 3. The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

Step 4. Yes, that's correct. In this case $a$, $b$, and $c$ are 1, -1, and -1, respectively.

Step 5. So if we plug those values in, we get $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4*1*-1}}{2*1}$.

Step 6. That simplifies to $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$. So x can be either $\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ or $\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

Step 7. Now let's move to the second equation.

Step 8. Yes, we need to find $x^3 - 2x + 1$.

Step 9. Right. Well since we now know that $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$, we can replace $x^2$ in the second equation with $x + 1$.

Step 10. That means that $x^3 - 2x + 1 = x(x + 1) - 2x + 1$.

Step 11. And if we substitute in the possible values of x that we found earlier, we get either $\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + 1) - 2\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + 1$ or $\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} + 1) - 2\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} + 1$.

Step 12. Let's start with the first case: $\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + 1) - 2\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + 1$.

Step 13. There's a shorter way. We have  $x^3 - 2x + 1 = x(x + 1) - 2x + 1$

Step 14.  $x^3 - 2x + 1 = (x^2 + x) - 2x + 1$

Step 15. And we know that $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$, so $x^2 = x + 1$.

Step 16. So we can just substitute $x + 1$ for $x^2$.

Step 17. So $x^3 - 2x + 1 = (x^2 + x) - 2x + 1$ becomes $x^3 - 2x + 1 = (x + 1 + x) - 2x + 1$

Step 18. And that simplifies to $x^3 - 2x + 1 = (2x + 1) - 2x + 1$

Step 19. So $x^3 - 2x + 1 = 2$.

Step 20. So, we don't need to do the second case because we already have the answer.

Step 21. Right. So if $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$ then $x^3 - 2x + 1 = 2$.

Question:

In 1992, a scoop of gelato could be purchased in Italy for 1200 lire. The same gelato would have cost $\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?

Answer:

Step 1. Let's call the number of dollars x. So, the problem is asking us to solve the equation x=1000000*$\\frac{1.50}{1200}$.

Step 2. There are two ways to solve this equation. We could either divide 1000000 by 1200 and then multiply the result by 1.50 or we could divide 1.50 by 1200 and then multiply the result by 1000000.

Step 3. I think the second way will be easier. $\\frac{1.50}{1200}=0.00125$.

Step 4. That's true. Now we just have to solve the equation x=1000000*0.00125.

Step 5. So x=$1250$.

Step 6. That's the final answer.

Step 7. Right. So 1,000,000 lire is equivalent to $\$1250$.

1250
