Question:

Find all values of $x$ such that $|x-3| = 5$.

Answer:

Step 1. Start with the equation $|x-3| = 5$.

Step 2. Recognize that the absolute value equation $|a| = b$ implies two cases: $a = b$ or $a = -b$.

Step 3. Apply this rule to $|x-3| = 5$, resulting in two equations: $x-3 = 5$ or $x-3 = -5$.

Step 4. Solve each equation: $x = 8$ from $x-3=5$ and $x = -2$ from $x-3=-5$.

Step 5. The solutions are $x = 8$ and $x = -2$.

# Answer

8 or -2

Question:

Given that  $\\mathbf{F}(r) = \\left( f(r), g(r), h(r) \\right)$  is a three-dimensional vector, prove that:  $\\forall r_1, r_2, \\exists r_1 < r^* < r_2 \\text{ such that } \\mathbf{F}(r_1) - \\mathbf{F}(r_2) = (r_1 - r_2) \\nabla \\mathbf{F}(r^*)$ .

Answer:

Step 1. Understanding the Given Information and Problem. We have a vector function $\\mathbf{F}(r) = \\left( f(r), \\\\ g(r), \\\\ h(r) \\right)$, where $f$, $g$, and $h$ are real-valued functions of the real variable $r$. We need to prove that for any $r_1$, $r_2$, there exists an $r^*$ such that $r_1 < r^* < r_2$ and $\\mathbf{F}(r_1) - \\mathbf{F}(r_2) = (r_1 - r_2) \\nabla \\mathbf{F}(r^*) $ where $\\nabla \\mathbf{F}(r^*)$ denotes the gradient of $\\mathbf{F}$ at $r^*$ (i.e., a vector composed of the derivatives of each component with respect to $r$).

Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem into Components. We can express the vector equation in terms of its components: $$\\left( f(r_1) - f(r_2), \\\\ g(r_1) - g(r_2),\\\\ h(r_1) - h(r_2) \\right) = (r_1 - r_2) \\left( f{\\prime}(r^*), \\\\ g{\\prime}(r^*),\\\\ h{\\prime}(r^*) \\right).$$ Thus, we need to find an $r^* \\in (r_1, r_2)$ such that for each component: $$\\frac{f(r_1) - f(r_2)}{r_1 - r_2} = f{\\prime}(r^*), \\quad \\frac{g(r_1) - g(r_2)}{r_1 - r_2} = g{\\prime}(r^*), \\quad \\frac{h(r_1) - h(r_2)}{r_1 - r_2} = h{\\prime}(r^*).$$

Step 3. Considering the Application of the One-Dimensional Mean Value Theorem In one dimension, the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states that for a function $f$ continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$, there exists $c \\in (a, b)$ such that: $$f(b) - f(a) = f{\\prime}(c)(b - a).$$ Applying the MVT to each component function $f$, $g$, and $h$, we obtain corresponding points $c_f$, $c_g$, and $c_h$. However, these points generally differ ($c_f \\neq c_g \\neq c_h$), so we cannot guarantee the existence of a common $r^*$ where all component equations hold simultaneously.

Step 4. Considering a Counterexample Since we cannot guarantee a common $r^*$ satisfying all components, let’s attempt to find a specific counterexample to demonstrate that the original proposition may not hold.

Step 5. Trying the Function $\\mathbf{F}(r) = (\\sin r,\\\\ \\cos r,\\\\ r)$ Let $\\mathbf{F}(r) = (\\sin r,\\\\ \\cos r,\\\\ r)$. Choose two distinct real numbers, for example, $r_1 = 0$ and $r_2 = \\pi$.

Step 6. Compute $\\mathbf{F}(r_1) - \\mathbf{F}(r_2)$: $\\mathbf{F}(0) - \\mathbf{F}(\\pi) = (\\sin 0 - \\sin \\pi,\\\\ \\cos 0 - \\cos \\pi,\\\\ 0 - \\pi) = (0 - 0,\\\\ 1 - (-1),\\\\ -\\pi) = (0,\\\\ 2,\\\\ -\\pi).$

Step 7. Compute $(r_1 - r_2) \\nabla \\mathbf{F}(r^*)$: $(r_1 - r_2) \\left( \\cos r^*,\\\\ -\\sin r^*,\\\\ 1 \\right) = (0 - \\pi) \\left( \\cos r^*,\\\\ -\\sin r^*,\\\\ 1 \\right) = (-\\pi) \\left( \\cos r^*,\\\\ -\\sin r^*,\\\\ 1 \\right).$

Step 8. We need to find $r^* \\in (0, \\pi)$ such that: $(0,\\\\ 2,\\\\ -\\pi) = (-\\pi \\cos r^*,\\\\ \\pi \\sin r^*,\\\\ -\\pi).$

Step 9. This leads to the equations: $-\\pi \\cos r^* = 0, \\quad \\pi \\sin r^* = 2, \\quad -\\pi = -\\pi.$

Step 10. The third equation is always true. Simplifying the first two equations: From $-\\pi \\cos r^* = 0$: $\\cos r^* = 0.$

Step 11. From $\\pi \\sin r^* = 2$: $\\sin r^* = \\frac{2}{\\pi}.$

Step 12. However, $\\cos r^* = 0$ implies $r^* = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Substituting $r^* = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ into the second equation: $\\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = 1 \\neq \\frac{2}{\\pi}.$

Step 13. Since $\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\approx 0.6366$, the equality does not hold. Therefore, there is no $r^*$ in $(0, \\pi)$ that satisfies both equations simultaneously.

Step 14. The above calculations show that for the function $\\mathbf{F}(r) = (\\sin r,\\\\ \\cos r,\\\\ r)$, there does not exist an $r^* \\in (r_1, r_2)$ such that: $\\mathbf{F}(r_1) - \\mathbf{F}(r_2) = (r_1 - r_2) \\nabla \\mathbf{F}(r^*).$ This counterexample disproves the original proposition.
